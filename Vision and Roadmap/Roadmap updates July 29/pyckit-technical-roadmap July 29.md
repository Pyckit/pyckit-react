## üí° Remember

**This is a living document**. Update it constantly. When in doubt, over-document. Your future self (and Claude) will thank you.

**Next Action**: Start with Week 1, Day 1 tasks. Check them off as you go. 

**You're building the future of passive commerce. Every line of code matters.** üöÄ
